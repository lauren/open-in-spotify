Ever hear a song in Songza and wish you could press repeat or save it to a playlist?

Open in Spotify to the rescue! Add this bookmarklet to your Bookmarks bar and click form Songza to open the song you're listening to in Spotify. Play it over and over, add it to a playlist, do whatever your Spotify thing is.
